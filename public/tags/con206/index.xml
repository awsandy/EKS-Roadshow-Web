      <description>Introduction to Kubernetes   A walkthrough of basic Kubernetes concepts.
Welcome to the Amazon EKS Roadshow!
The intent of this workshop is to educate users about the features of Amazon EKS.
Background in EKS, Kubernetes, Docker, and container workflows are not required, but they are recommended.
This chapter will introduce you to the basic workings of Kubernetes, laying the foundation for the hands-on portion of the workshop.
Specifically, we will walk you through the following topics:</description>

      <description>Launch using eksctl eksctl is a tool jointly developed by AWS and Weaveworks that automates much of the experience of creating EKS clusters.
In this module, we will use eksctl to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.</description>

      <description>Helm   This tutorial has been updated for Helm v3. In version 3, the Tiller component was removed, which simplified operations and improved security.
 If you need to migrate from Helm v2 to v3 click here for the official documentation.
 Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that packages multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit called a Chart. Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish.</description>

      <title>Deploying Microservices to EKS Fargate</title>
      <link>//localhost:50906/beginner/180_fargate/</link>

      <description>Deploying Microservices to EKS Fargate   AWS Fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute capacity for containers. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale groups of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your node groups, or optimize cluster packing. You can control which pods start on Fargate and how they run with Fargate profiles, which are defined as part of your Amazon EKS cluster.</description>

      <title>EKS CloudWatch Container Insights</title>
      <link>//localhost:50906/beginner/250_cloudwatch_container_insights/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:50906/beginner/250_cloudwatch_container_insights/</guid>
      <description>In this chapter we will learn and leverage the new CloudWatch Container Insights to see how you can use native CloudWatch features to monitor your EKS Cluster performance.
You can use CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.</description>
