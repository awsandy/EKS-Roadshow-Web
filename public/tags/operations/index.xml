      <description>Patching/Upgrading your EKS Cluster As EKS tracks upstream Kubernetes that means that customers can, and should, regularly upgrade their EKS so as to stay within the project&amp;rsquo;s upstream support window. This used to be the current version and two version back (n-2) - but it was recently extended to three versions back (n-3).
There is a new major version of Kubernetes every quarter which means that the Kubernetes support window has now gone from three quarters of a year to one full year.</description>
