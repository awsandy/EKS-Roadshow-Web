# Helm

{{< youtube XIVCS2j_JxU >}}


[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that packages
multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit called
a **Chart**. Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish.

In this chapter, we'll cover [installing Helm](helm_intro).  Once installed,
we'll demonstrate how Helm can be used to [deploy a simple nginx
webserver](helm_nginx).
